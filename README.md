# OneKey Bridge

You could obtain binary files and installer packages at [release](https://github.com/OneKeyHQ/onekey-bridge/releases) page

## How To Build (Both binary and installer)

Please refer to [Build.md](Build.md)

All version numbers are controlled by `VERSION` at root level, no need to change other files

For things work properly , be sure to follow build methods documented in [Build.md](Build.md)

## Launch Parameters

### HTTP Server Port Configuration

OneKey bridge runs an HTTP server on port 21320 by default. You can change this port using the `-p` parameter.

**Examples:**
- `./onekeyd` - Uses default port 21320
- `./onekeyd -p 21325` - Uses port 21325
- `./onekeyd -p 20321` - Uses port 20321

This is useful when:
- Running multiple bridge instances simultaneously
- Port 21320 is already in use by another application
- You need to use a specific port for network configuration

### Emulator Support

OneKey bridge has emulator support, but it's disabled by default.

To enable emulator support, launch with `-e` parameter followed by port, for example `./onekeyd -e 54935`

To disable all USB in order to run on some virtual environments,launch with `-u=false` parameter, for example `./onekeyd -u=false`

**Combined Examples:**
- `./onekeyd -p 21325 -e 54935` - HTTP server on port 21325, emulator on port 54935
- `./onekeyd -p 20321 -u=false` - HTTP server on port 20321, USB disabled
- `./onekeyd -p 20321 -e 54935 -u=false` - HTTP server on port 20321,emulator on port 54935, USB disabled

If you want change default launch options,  you may have to change service accordingly

## Edit Default Service Launch Options

On Linux, `sudo systemctl edit --full onekeyd.service` to edit the service control file

On MacOS, open `/Library/LaunchAgents/so.onekey.bridge.onekeyd.plist` to edit the service control file

On Windows, open `shell:startup` folder, then edit the `OneKey Bridge.lnk` file

## API documentation

`onekey-bridge` starts a HTTP server on `http://localhost:21320` by default. The port can be configured using the `-p` parameter (see Launch Parameters section above). AJAX calls are only enabled from onekey.so subdomains.

Server supports following API calls:

| url <br> method | parameters | result type | description |
|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `/` <br> POST | | {`version`:&nbsp;string} | Returns current version of bridge |
| `/enumerate` <br> POST | | Array&lt;{`path`:&nbsp;string, <br>`session`:&nbsp;string&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;null}&gt; | Lists devices.<br>`path` uniquely defines device between more connected devices. Two different devices (or device connected and disconnected) will return different paths.<br>If `session` is null, nobody else is using the device; if it's string, it identifies who is using it. |
| `/listen` <br> POST | request body: previous, as JSON | like `enumerate` | Listen to changes and returns either on change or after 30 second timeout. Compares change from `previous` that is sent as a parameter. "Change" is both connecting/disconnecting and session change. |
| `/acquire/PATH/PREVIOUS` <br> POST | `PATH`: path of device<br>`PREVIOUS`: previous session (or string "null") | {`session`:&nbsp;string} | Acquires the device at `PATH`. By "acquiring" the device, you are claiming the device for yourself.<br>Before acquiring, checks that the current session is `PREVIOUS`.<br>If two applications call `acquire` on a newly connected device at the same time, only one of them succeed. |
| `/release/SESSION`<br>POST | `SESSION`: session to release | {} | Releases the device with the given session.<br>By "releasing" the device, you claim that you don't want to use the device anymore. |
| `/call/SESSION`<br>POST | `SESSION`: session to call<br><br>request body: hexadecimal string | hexadecimal string | Both input and output are hexadecimal, encoded in following way:<br>first 2 bytes (4 characters in the hexadecimal) is the message type<br>next 4 bytes (8 in hex) is length of the data<br>the rest is the actual encoded protobuf data.<br>Protobuf messages are defined in [this protobuf file](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-common/blob/master/protob/messages.proto) and the app, calling onekey, should encode/decode it itself. |
| `/post/SESSION`<br>POST | `SESSION`: session to call<br><br>request body: hexadecimal string | 0 | Similar to `call`, just doesn't read response back. Usable mainly for debug link. |
| `/read/SESSION`<br>POST | `SESSION`: session to call | 0 | Similar to `call`, just doesn't post, only reads. Usable mainly for debug link. |

## Debug link support

OneKey Bridge has support for debug link.

To support an emulator with debug link, run

`./onekeyd -ed 54935:21320 -u=false`

this will detect emulator debug link on port 21320, with regular device on 54935.

To support WebUSB devices with debug link, no option is needed, just run onekey-bridge.

In the `enumerate` and `listen` results, there are now two new fields: `debug` and `debugSession`. `debug` signals that device can receive debug link messages.

Session management is separate for debug link and normal interface, so you can have two applications - one controlling OneKey and one "normal".

There are new calls:

* `/debug/acquire/PATH`, which has the same path as normal `acquire`, and returns a `SESSION`
* `/debug/release/SESSION` releases session
* `/debug/call/SESSION`, `/debug/post/SESSION`, `/debug/read/SESSION` work as with normal interface

The session IDs for debug link start with the string "debug".
